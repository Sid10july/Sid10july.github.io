        <p>
          Hi 👋 I’m currently a BS/MS student in Computer Science at UC San Diego,
          broadly interested in the intersection of
          <strong>computer systems and machine learning</strong>. I like
          building methods that make ML <strong>faster, cheaper, and easier
          to run on real hardware</strong> — from edge devices to larger
          LLM-based systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now I’m applying to graduate programs where I can work on
          <strong>efficient ML systems</strong>, including topics like
          hyperdimensional computing (HDC), resource-aware training and
          inference, and cost-aware LLM agents. My long-term goal is to design
          learning systems that keep state-of-the-art models usable even when
          compute, memory, or energy are limited.
        </p>

        <p>
            I currently work in the <strong>System Energy &amp; Efficiency Lab (SEELab)</strong> at UCSD with Professor Tajana Rosing and Professor Flavio Ponzina, where I’ve been exploring 
            <strong>unsupervised ensemble learning with high-dimensional computing</strong>. I’m the lead author on a work under submission (MultiProjHD) that studies how random projections and centroid alignment can reduce memory and compute while improving clustering accuracy, and I co-authored a paper accepted to <strong>ICCD&nbsp;2024</strong> on efficient ML for edge/IoT settings. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I also contribute to the <strong>Hao AI Lab</strong>, under Prof. Hao Zhang, working on <strong>FastVideo</strong> — a project focused on accelerating video diffusion models through low-rank decomposition and other system-level optimizations aimed at improving throughput on modern hardware. 
            In addition, I’m currently leading <strong>CoPAL-L</strong>, a cost-of-pass–aware LLM-agent framework designed to reason jointly about quality, latency, and monetary cost when planning tool calls.
          </p>

        <p>
          Previously, I worked as a <strong>System Software Engineering
          Intern at Cadence</strong>, focusing on multi-socket server
          utilization and performance regression pipelines, and as a
          <strong>Data Science Engineering Intern at Sabre</strong>, where I
          built forecasting pipelines with XGBoost, BigQuery, and production
          ETL workflows. These experiences convinced me that the most
          impactful ML work sits at the boundary of algorithms, systems, and
          real-world constraints.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of research, I enjoy mentoring students who are new to ML
          and systems and have been involved with UCSD’s PRISM/IDEA programs
          and various course projects in machine learning, systems, and HCI.
          If you’re working on <strong>efficient ML systems, HDC, or
          cost-aware LLM agents</strong>, I’d love to connect.
        </p>
